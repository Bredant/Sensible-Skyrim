# Sensible Skyrim

- [Necessary Information](https://github.com/Bredant/Sensible-Skyrim/blob/main/README.md#necessary-information-beforehand)

## Necessary Information Beforehand

**First and foremost the Anniversary Edition of the game is required. It is NOT optional.** 

  Sensible Skyrim aims to provide a great looking, stable, lore friendly, fully enhanced vanilla plus game. Mod additions are based upon what makes sense from a lore friendly point of view without sacrificing a fun and fair gameplay experience. Performance is tuned for 60 fps on higher end machines.

  Having a decent computer is required. This list was created using a 12600k, rtx 3080, 32gb ram, nVME drive. Using this setup, locked 60 fps @1440p was achieved in 99% of the game using this modlist. 

  Further testing information using a 3700x, 2080 super, 16gb ram, nVME drive will be provided at a later date. As of now, I would consider this to be the minimum required specs.  
  
  ## Installation
  ### Before you Install
  Setting up Skyrim properly before-hand is a hard requirement. Follow these steps to do so now.
  1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package [Here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
  2. Disable the Steam Overlay - Open the Properties window (right-click the game in your Library->Properties), navigate to the General tab, and un-tick the Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game checkbox.
  3. Make sure your Steam Library is NOT in Program Files. It should be in a root directory (IE: C:/Steam).
  4. Uninstall the game through Steam, delete the game folder, and reinstall it. Clean up the Skyrim Special Edition folder in Documents/My Games/ by deleting its contents.
  5. Right click on the game in steam and go to Properties then the Updates tab. Change Automatic updates to Only update this game when I launch it. 
  6. Start the Launcher and let it do the initial graphics check. Ignore the settings as they will be automatically configured later. Start Skyrim.
  7. Login to Creation Club and download all content then close Skyrim.

### Wabbajack Installation
1. Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the Wabbajack.exe file in a working folder. This folder must NOT be in a common folder like your Desktop, Downloads, or Program Files folder. It's best to create a Wabbajack folder near your drive's root level like C:/Wabbajack.
2. Open Wabbajack.
3. Click browse modlists and tick show unofficial lists. Download Sensible Skyrim.
4. Create two new folders named Sensible Skyrim and Wabbajack Downloads on your preferred root drive.
5. Change the download and installation paths to the folders created previously. 
6. Click the Go/Begin button.
7. Wait for Wabbajack to finish.

If you experience any errors close Wabbajack and run the list again. If the errors still persist post on discord in the help channel for assistance.
